## Overview

This repository contains an advanced Bash script for conducting a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment. The script empowers security professionals to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in both network infrastructure and web applications, strengthening an organization's overall security posture.



## Features

- Parallel Processing: The script utilizes parallel processing to optimize the scanning process and expedite the assessments.

- Multiple Scans: The tool integrates powerful security tools such as Nessus, Nmap, Nikto, SQLMap, BeEF, Metasploit, and more, to ensure a holistic security evaluation.

- Methodologies from TCM Security: Inspired by TCM Security's Web Application Testing approach, the script follows proven techniques for comprehensive assessments.

- Logs and Reports: The tool saves scan results in dedicated log files, ensuring easy access to valuable information.
